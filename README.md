## Introduction
PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) is a Battle Royale-style video game. 100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed and must explore, scavenge, and eliminate other players until only one is left standing, all while the play zone continues to shrink. In this challenge, 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data are given, split into training and testing sets, and we are asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.
